# Competitive-Programming
A compilation of my Accepted(100%) submissions to CP and Olympiad in Informatics(OI) problems

### Notes

Rename all files to include their years, it's kinda confusing

Also, I have a lot more submissions that I haven't yet included but I'll do that some day...

Username is Dan4life on most CP Sites and most of the OI submissions can be checked on my oj.uz account :)

CF: Div1D4Life (to be changed to Dan4life in the future)
