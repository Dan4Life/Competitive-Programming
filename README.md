# Competitive-Programming
A compilation of my Accepted(100%) submissions to CP and Olympiad in Informatics(OI) problems

### Notes

Rename all files to include their years, it's kinda confusing

Also, I have a lot more submissions that I haven't yet included but I'll do that some day...

Most of the OI submissions can be checked on my oj.uz account :)

CF:   Dan4Life

AtCoder:   Dan4Life

CodeChef:   Dan4Life

Oj.uz:   Dan4Life

I'm starting to see a pattern here...
